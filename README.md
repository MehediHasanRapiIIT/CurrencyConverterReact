# Currency Converter App

A modern, responsive currency converter application built with React and Vite. This app allows users to convert currencies in real-time using live exchange rates.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-time Currency Conversion**: Convert between multiple currencies using live exchange rates
- **Swap Functionality**: Easily swap between "from" and "to" currencies with a single click
- **Responsive Design**: Beautiful, responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS
- **Custom React Hook**: Utilizes a custom `useCurrencyInfo` hook for fetching currency data
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for API failures

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The application is built using modern React patterns and consists of several key components:

### Core Components

1. **App.jsx**: Main application component that manages the conversion logic and state
2. **InputBox.jsx**: Reusable input component for amount entry and currency selection
3. **useCurrencyInfo.js**: Custom React hook that fetches live currency exchange rates

### Data Flow

1. **Currency Selection**: Users select their base currency (from) and target currency (to)
2. **Amount Input**: Users enter the amount they want to convert
3. **API Call**: The `useCurrencyInfo` hook fetches live exchange rates from the currency API
4. **Conversion**: The app calculates the converted amount using the fetched exchange rates
5. **Display**: Results are displayed in real-time in the second input box

### Custom Hook Implementation

The `useCurrencyInfo` hook:
- Fetches data from `@fawazahmed0/currency-api`
- Uses React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks
- Implements error handling for failed API requests
- Returns currency exchange rate data for the selected base currency
